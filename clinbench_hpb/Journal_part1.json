        "patient_info": "Chief Complaint: The patient, a 14-year-old boy, presented with abnormal liver-function test results persisting for approximately 1.5 years. He had a history of multiple chronic illnesses, including type 1 diabetes mellitus, primary hypothyroidism, and recurrent infections. The abnormal liver tests prompted referral to the gastroenterology clinic for further evaluation.\nPatient Information and Medical History: The patient is a 14-year-and-8-month-old male of Italian and Irish ancestry with a significant past medical history. He was born via vaginal delivery following an uncomplicated full-term gestation. At birth, he was noted to have cryptorchidism (undescended testis), which was later addressed with orchidopexy and inguinal herniorrhaphy at 15 months of age. During infancy, he was diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and failure to thrive. His medical conditions include type 1 diabetes mellitus, primary hypothyroidism, mild speech delay, and learning disabilities. He has a history of recurrent infections, including sinusitis, streptococcal pharyngitis, and pneumonias, as well as nocturia and leukoplakia of the tongue. Genetic evaluation at 2 years of age demonstrated a normal karyotype. Additionally, he has sustained orthopedic injuries secondary to sports-related trauma. His family medical history is notable for a maternal uncle with learning disabilities, developmental delay, hypogammaglobulinemia, cryptogenic cirrhosis, splenic artery aneurysms, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and bone marrow failure; a maternal great-grandmother with scleroderma; and a paternal grandmother with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include insulin administered via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump) and levothyroxine. The patient has no known medication allergies.",
        "laboratory_tests": "Laboratory testing revealed several abnormal indicators, including a hematocrit of 30.9% (reference range: 36.0–49.0), hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL (reference range: 12.0–16.9), and a platelet count of 140,000/mm³ (reference range: 150,000–450,000), consistent with anemia and thrombocytopenia. Liver function tests were notable for elevated total bilirubin at 3.6 mg/dL (reference range: 0.2–1.1), alkaline phosphatase at 402 U/L (reference range: 70–390), aspartate aminotransferase at 80 U/L (reference range: 2–40), alanine aminotransferase at 47 U/L (reference range: 3–30), and γ-glutamyltransferase at 75 U/L (reference range: 12–55), indicating hepatic dysfunction. Immunological studies demonstrated low IgM levels at 25 mg/dL (reference range: 55–334) and suboptimal pneumococcal antibody titers post-vaccination, suggesting impaired humoral immunity. In contrast, normal or negative results were observed for complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, vitamin B₁₂ levels, C-reactive protein, antinuclear antibody titers, monospot test, Lyme disease testing, and DNA analysis for CADASIL. Additionally, prothrombin-time international normalized ratio, lipid profile, red-cell osmotic fragility, ceruloplasmin, iron studies, iron-binding capacity, IgG levels, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) levels were within normal limits.",

A brain MRI performed at 10 years of age demonstrated numerous nonspecific focal lesions in the periventricular and corona radiata white matter, each measuring ≤8 mm in diameter, without gadolinium enhancement. These findings are suggestive of potential etiologies such as myelination disorders, vasculitis, or infections like Lyme disease. Abdominal imaging conducted at 14 years of age included an ultrasound, which revealed heterogeneously hypoechoic parenchymal nodules in the liver, consistent with macronodular cirrhosis, without a dominant mass. The portal vein was patent with normal flow, and splenomegaly was noted in the absence of varices. Subsequent abdominal MRI confirmed heterogeneous hepatic parenchymal enhancement and splenomegaly, with no evidence of bile-duct dilatation or ascites. ",

The symptoms began several weeks before admission and worsened in the two weeks prior, with a 3 kg weight loss noted during this period.\nPatient Information and Medical History: The patient is a 17-year-old male student with no history of alcohol or illicit drug use. Seventeen months prior, he was hospitalized for bloody diarrhea, diagnosed with Clostridium difficile infection, and treated with a one-month course of metronidazole. He had no family history of inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatic disorders. His immunizations were up to date, including hepatitis B vaccination. Physical examination revealed mild scleral icterus, sternal tenderness, and slight right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness. Stool was positive for occult blood, and urine was dark.",
        "laboratory_tests": "Laboratory findings included leukocytosis with a leftward shift, elevated aspartate aminotransferase (75 U/L), elevated alkaline phosphatase, low albumin, calcium, and cholesterol levels, and prolonged prothrombin time.
